# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 



I was asked to create a calendar application that meets the following criteria:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
